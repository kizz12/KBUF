Kizz's Book of Useful Functions (for Lua Computercraft in Minecraft)

This is just a series of useful functions andexamples from my career writing Lua code for MCCC. 

You're welcome to steal these for your own creations if you wish or even help improve them. 

Otherwise, this is more just a personal wiki of functions.
